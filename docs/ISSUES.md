# ISSUES

* **Piece Rotation:** Some pieces rotate incorrectly due to shape inconsistencies.
* **Game Crash on Reset:** The game crashes when the map resets after game over.
* **Piece Positioning:** The offset and limit calculations for the current piece are incorrect.
* **Piece Coordinates:** Piece positions become incorrect after rotation due to issues in how piece coordinates are generated and updated.
